// Variables

// Servo object for controlling turbine orientation
// Servo object for controlling blade pitch
// Previous wind speed                                Last recorded wind speed
// Previous wind direction                            Last recorded wind direction
// Array of logs                                      Stores wind speed, direction, and angles

/** ## Setup
 * This function initializes the system by setting up:
 * - The emergency stop and end-of-day data logging buttons
 * - Servo motors for turbine orientation and blade pitch
 * - Serial communication for logging
 * - User-defined cut-in and cut-out speeds
 */
void setup()
{
    // Configure the emergency stop and end-of-day data logging button pins as input with pull-up resistors
    // Attach the turbine orientation servo to the specified pin
    // Attach the blade pitch servo to the specified pin

    // Initialize serial communication for logging data
    // Get user input for cut-in and cut-out wind speeds
    // Output system ready message via serial
}

/** ## The Main Loop
 * This is the main loop of the program. It continuously:
 * - Monitors the emergency stop and end-of-day data logging buttons
 * - Reads wind speed and direction from sensors
 * - Controls the turbine orientation and blade pitch based on wind conditions
 * - Logs data if wind conditions change
 */

    // Read the wind speed and direction from sensors
    // Adjust turbine orientation and blade pitch based on the wind conditions
    // Log data if wind speed or direction changes

    // Add a small delay to reduce CPU usage
}

/** ## Emergency Stop Handler
 * This function is triggered when the emergency stop button is pressed.
 * It immediately:
 * - Stops the turbine by setting the orientation to a neutral position
 * - Sets the blade pitch to zero degrees
 * - Waits for the emergency stop button to be released before resuming operation
 */

{
    // Check if the emergency stop button is pressed
    // If pressed:
    // - Log an emergency stop message
    // - Set turbine orientation to a neutral position (90 degrees)
    // - Set blade pitch to zero degrees
    // - Wait until the button is released to resume operation
}

/** ## Read Wind Speed
 * This function reads the wind speed from the sensor and converts the analog value to a meaningful wind speed value in m/s.
 * It logs the raw sensor value for debugging purposes.
 */
float readWindSpeed()
{
    // Read the analog value from the wind speed sensor
    // Convert the analog value to wind speed in m/s

 * This function reads the wind direction from the sensor and converts the analog value to a direction in degrees (0-360).
 * It logs the raw sensor value for debugging purposes.
 */

    // Convert the analog value to wind direction in degrees
    // Return the calculated wind direction
}

/** ## Control Turbine and Blades
 * This function controls the turbine's orientation and blade pitch based on the current wind speed and direction.
 * It adjusts the turbine to face the wind and modifies the blade pitch to optimize power generation.
 */

    // - Calculate the turbine orientation angle based on wind direction (0-180 degrees)
    // - Adjust the blade pitch angle based on wind speed (0-45 degrees)
    // - Log the turbine and blade pitch angles for monitoring

    // If wind speed is outside the operational range:
    // - Set blade pitch to zero degrees
    // - Set turbine orientation to a fixed position

/** ## Log Data
 * This function logs data when wind speed or direction changes.
 * It stores the wind speed, direction, and turbine/blade angles in an array.
 */

{
    // Log the wind speed, direction, turbine angle, and blade pitch angle
    // Store the data in the log array
    // Increment the log index to store the next data point
}

/** ## End-of-Day Data Logging
 * This function logs summary data at the end of the day when the corresponding button is pressed.
 * It provides an overview of the wind conditions, including all logged wind speed, direction, and angle data.
 */
