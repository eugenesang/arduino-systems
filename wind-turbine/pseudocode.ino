// Variables

// Servo object for controlling turbine orientation
// Servo object for controlling blade pitch
// Last log time                                      Timestamp of the last data log
// Last daily log time                                Timestamp of the last end-of-day data log

/** ## Setup
 * This function initializes the system by setting up:
 * - The emergency stop button
 * - Servo motors for turbine orientation and blade pitch
 * - Serial communication for logging
 */
void setup()
{
    // Configure the emergency stop button pin as input with pull-up resistor
    // Attach the turbine orientation servo to the specified pin
    // Attach the blade pitch servo to the specified pin

    // Initialize serial communication for logging data
    // Output a system initialization message via serial
}

/** ## The Main Loop
 * This is the main loop of the program. It continuously:
 * - Monitors the emergency stop button
 * - Reads wind speed and direction from sensors
 * - Controls the turbine orientation and blade pitch based on wind conditions
 * - Logs data at regular intervals
 * - Logs daily summary data at the end of each 24-hour period
 */
void loop()
{
    // Check if the emergency stop button is pressed

    // If the emergency stop button is not pressed:
    // - Read the wind speed from the sensor
    // - Read the wind direction from the sensor
    // - Adjust turbine orientation and blade pitch based on the wind conditions

    // Log data at regular intervals
    // Log end-of-day summary data at the end of each 24-hour period

    // Add a small delay to reduce CPU usage
}

/** ## Emergency Stop Handler
 * This function is triggered when the emergency stop button is pressed.
 * It immediately:
 * - Stops the turbine by setting the orientation to a neutral position
 * - Sets the blade pitch to zero degrees
 * - Halts the program indefinitely
 */
void handleEmergencyStop()
{
    // Check if the emergency stop button is pressed
    // If pressed:
    // - Log an emergency stop message
    // - Set turbine orientation to a neutral position (90 degrees)
    // - Set blade pitch to zero degrees
    // - Enter an infinite loop to halt further operation
}

/** ## Read Wind Speed
 * This function reads the wind speed from the sensor and converts the analog value to a meaningful wind speed value in m/s.
 * It logs the raw sensor value for debugging purposes.
 */
float readWindSpeed()
{
    // Read the analog value from the wind speed sensor
    // Convert the analog value to wind speed in m/s
    // Log the raw sensor value
    // Return the calculated wind speed
}

/** ## Read Wind Direction
 * This function reads the wind direction from the sensor and converts the analog value to a direction in degrees (0-360).
 * It logs the raw sensor value for debugging purposes.
 */
float readWindDirection()
{
    // Read the analog value from the wind direction sensor
    // Convert the analog value to wind direction in degrees
    // Log the raw sensor value
    // Return the calculated wind direction
}

/** ## Control Turbine and Blades
 * This function controls the turbine's orientation and blade pitch based on the current wind speed and direction.
 * It adjusts the turbine to face the wind and modifies the blade pitch to optimize power generation.
 */

{

    // If within range:
    // - Calculate the turbine orientation angle based on wind direction (0-180 degrees)
    // - Adjust the blade pitch angle based on wind speed (0-45 degrees)
    // - Log the wind speed, direction, and blade pitch for monitoring

    // If wind speed is outside the operational range:
    // - Set blade pitch to zero degrees
    // - Set turbine orientation to a fixed position
}

/** ## Log Data
 * This function logs data at regular intervals.
 * It checks if the current time exceeds the last log time by the specified interval and logs the necessary data.
 */
void logData()
{
    // Get the current time in milliseconds
    // Check if the time since the last log exceeds the logging interval
    // If yes, log the data and update the last log time
}

/** ## End-of-Day Data Logging
 * This function logs summary data at the end of each 24-hour period.
 * It provides an overview of the wind conditions over the day, including the last measured wind speed and direction.
 */
void logEndOfDayData(float windSpeed, float windDirection)
{

    // Check if the time since the last daily log exceeds the daily logging interval
